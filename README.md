# RELATIVE VELOCITY
<h4> Synopsis about our project </h4>

We have developed this project for relative velocity experiment simulations.
We can find relative velocity of an object or two objects using this project.
This project is suitable for student who follow relative velocity for their studies 
and lectures also can use this simulation for their relative velocity lectures.


we used jquery,bootstrap, html,css and javascript.

<h4> Getting started </h4>

this can use online or download the relative velocity folder and run the index.html file on your browser.
Click on the instruction button to know how to give data for simulation.

<h4><a href="Relative velocity/index.html">Start Simulation Here</a> </h4>



<h4> Tests </h4>
 for one object case object can have two chances for velocity: 
	(1)Velocity Relative to Ground
	(2)Velocity to river
	
		->	->	->
		V(o,r)=V(o,g)+V(r,g)
		
		->	->	->
		V(o,g)=V(o,r)+V(r,g)
		
	 we find the details which is not given when either of above case occur.
			(1)object relative velocity to river
			(2)object relative velocity to ground
			(3)degree relative to river
			(4)distance object swim when pass the river
			(5)distance of object from "opposite end of starting" to end position 
			(6)time to reach other end
	

			
 	two object have velocities for objects and starting distance.That case find the following details
			(1)having shortest distance or not
			(2)if the objects are meeting 
			(3)if meeting or have shortest distance time taken to that situation
			(4)relative velocities  relative to other object
			(5)bearing
